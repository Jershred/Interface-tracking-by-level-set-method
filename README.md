## Project
### Introduction
The next practical work aims to study the level-set method for interface tracking. This method is used to track the evolution of a surface in a velocity field. It is widely used in the fields of physics and engineering to model the evolution of surfaces in velocity fields, in order to simulate phenomena such as the deformation of solids, the diffusion of chemicals, and the propagation of waves. 

In this practical work, we will apply the level-set method to the test cases of the serpentine and the Zalesak disk. The serpentine test case consists of a deformation of a disk by a vortex, while the Zalesak disk test case consists of the advection of a disk in a velocity field. We will study different space and time schemes, as well as their coupling, and characterize their performance on the two test cases. We will also show the space (numerical) convergence error for each of the space schemes.
